        <li>
            <strong>Use your time wisely: </strong>Calculate how much time you have to answer every question on the test and how much time you wish to allocate to each section.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Answer practice questions ahead of time: </strong>After you become generally familiar with all question types, use the practice answering sample questions to prepare for the actual test. It may be useful to time yourself as you answer the practice questions to get an idea of how long you will have for each question when you sit for the actual test, as well as to determine whether you are answering quickly enough to finish the test in the allotted time.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Read all the test directions carefully</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Read each question carefully and thoughtfully: </strong>Never skim a question or the possible answers; skimming may cause you to miss important information or nuances.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Do not spend too much time on any one question: </strong>If you do not know the correct answer, or if the question is too time consuming, try to eliminate choices you know are wrong, select the best of the remaining
            answer choices, and move on to the next question.

            <span class="underline">Fractions</span>
            <ol>
                <li>A fraction is of the form 
                    \begin{equation}
                    \begin{split} 
                    \frac{n}{d}
                    \end{split} 
                    \end{equation} 
                    where <em>n</em> is the <em>numerator</em> and <em>d</em> is the denominator.</li>
                <li>Two fractions are said to be equivalent if they represent the same fractions when reduced to the lowest terms by their <em>Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)</em></li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Addition and Subtraction of Fractions: </strong>Two fractions with the same denominator can be added or subtracted by performing the required operation with the numerators, leaving the denominators the same. For the new denominator, choosing the least common multiple (lcm) of the denominators usually lessens the work.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Multiplication and Division of Fractions: </strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>To multiply two fractions, simply multiply the two numerators and multiply the two denominators.</li>
                        <li>
                            To divide by a fraction, invert the divisor (that is, find its reciprocal) and multiply. For example,
                            \begin{equation}
                            \begin{split} 
                            \frac{2}{3}  \div  \frac{4}{7}  = \frac{2}{3}  \times  \frac{7}{4}  =  \frac{14}{12} =  \frac{7}{6}
                            \end{split} 
                            \end{equation}
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Mixed Fractions: </strong>A number that consists of a whole number and a fraction.
                    <br>
                    For example, a mixed fraction only means
                    \begin{equation}
                    \begin{split} 
                    7\frac{2}{3}=7+\frac{2}{3}
                    \end{split} 
                    \end{equation}
                    To change a mixed number into a fraction, multiply the whole number by the denominator of the fraction and add this number to the numerator of the fraction; then put the result over the denominator of the fraction. For example,
                    \begin{equation}
                    \begin{split} 
                    7\frac{2}{3}=\frac{(7\times 3) + 2}{3}=\frac{23}{3}
                    \end{split} 
                    \end{equation}
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="underline">Decimals: </span> Numbers in the decimal system are expressed in powers of 10. For example,
            \begin{equation}
            \begin{split} 
            7654.321=(7\times1000)+(6\times100)+(5\times10)+4+\frac{3}{10}+\frac{2}{100}+\frac{1}{1000}
            \end{split} 
            \end{equation}
            Sometimes decimals are expressed as the product of a number with only one digit to the left of the decimal point and a power of 10. This is called <em>scientific notation</em>. For example
            \begin{equation}
            \begin{split} 
            231=2.31\times10^{2}
            \end{split} 
            \end{equation}
            \begin{equation}
            \begin{split} 
            0.0231=2.31\times10^{-2}
            \end{split} 
            \end{equation}
            The decimal point is moved to the right if the exponent is positive and to the left if the exponent is negative.
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Addition and Subtraction of Decimals: </strong>To add or subtract two decimals, the decimal points of both numbers should be lined up. If one of the numbers has fewer digits to the right of the decimal point than the other, zeros may be inserted to the right of the last digit.
                    \begin{array}{l r}
                    & 17.6512\\
                    +& 653.2700\\
                    \hline
                    & 670.9212
                    \end{array}
                    or

                    \hline
                    & 635.6188

                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Multiplication of Decimals: </strong>To multiply decimals, multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers and then insert the decimal point in the product so that the number of digits to the right of the decimal point is equal to the sum of the numbers of digits to the right of the decimal points in the numbers being multiplied.
                    <br>
                    For eg. in the example below, we have a number with 02 decimal places multiplied with another number having 01 decimal place resulting in a number having 03 decimal digits.
                    \begin{array}{l r}
                    & 2.09\\
                    \times& 1.3\\

                <li>
                    <strong>Division of Decimals: </strong>To divide a number (the dividend) by a decimal (the divisor), move the decimal point of the divisor to
                    the right until the divisor is a whole number. Then move the decimal point of the dividend the same number of places to the right, and divide as you would by a whole number. Apply the decimal to the quotient as the first decimal digit from the dividend is carried down for division.
                    <br>
                    For eg.
                    \begin{equation}
                    \begin{split} 
                    \frac{698.12}{12.4}=\frac{6981.2}{124}

            <ol>
                <li>All real numbers correspond to points on the number line and all points on the number line correspond to real numbers.</li>
                <li>For any two numbers on the number line, the number to the left is less than the number to the right</li>
                <li>The distance between a number and zero on the number line is called the absolute value of the number. Thus 3 and −3 have the same absolute value, 3, since they are both three units from zero. The absolute value of 3 is denoted |3|.</li>

                            <strong>Commutative Property of Addition and Multiplication: </strong>x + y = y + x and xy = yx.

                            For example, 8 + 3 = 3 + 8 = 11, and (l7)(5) = (5)(l7) = 85.

                    \end{equation}
                    cross multiply the two, obtaining 24 = 3n; then divide both sides by 3, to get n = 8.

                    <strong>Percent Change: </strong>To find the <em>percent increase</em>, first find the amount of the increase; then divide this increase by the

                            The standard deviation depends on every data value, although it depends most on values that are farthest from the mean. This is why <em>a distribution with data grouped closely around the mean will have a smaller standard deviation than will data spread far from the mean</em>.

                    <strong>Statistical Measures of Distribution: </strong>There are many ways to display numerical data that show how the data are distributed. One simple way is with a frequency distribution, which is useful for data that have values occurring with varying frequencies.
