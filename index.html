    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Use your time wisely: </strong>Calculate how much time you have to answer every question on the test and how much time you wish to allocate to each section.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Answer practice questions ahead of time: </strong>After you become generally familiar with all question types, use the practice answering sample questions to prepare for the actual test. It may be useful to time yourself as you answer the practice questions to get an idea of how long you will have for each question when you sit for the actual test, as well as to determine whether you are answering quickly enough to finish the test in the allotted time.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Read all the test directions carefully</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Read each question carefully and thoughtfully: </strong>Never skim a question or the possible answers; skimming may cause you to miss important information or nuances.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Do not spend too much time on any one question: </strong>If you do not know the correct answer, or if the question is too time consuming, try to eliminate choices you know are wrong, select the best of the remaining
            answer choices, and move on to the next question.

                    Additionally, considering

                    <strong>Odd and Even: </strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Any integer that is divisible by 2 is an <em>even</em> integer; the set of even integers is {. . . −4, −2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, . . .}.</li>
                        <li>Integers that are not divisible by 2 are <em>odd</em> integers; {. . . −3, −1, 1, 3, 5, . . .} is the set of odd integers.</li>
                        <li>If two integers are <em>both even or both odd</em>, then their sum and their difference are even. Otherwise, their sum and their difference are odd.</li>
                        <li>If <em>at least one factor of a product of integers is even</em>, then the product is even; otherwise the product is odd.</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li>A prime number is a positive integer that has exactly two different positive divisors, 1 and itself.</li>
                        <li>The number 1 is not a prime number since it has only one positive divisor.</li>
                        <li>Every integer greater than 1 either is prime or can be uniquely expressed as a product of prime factors.</li>

                        <li>The numbers −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are consecutive integers. Consecutive integers can be represented by n, n + 1, n + 2, n + 3, . . ., where n is an integer.</li>
                        <li>The numbers 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 are consecutive even integers and can be represented by 2 n , 2 n + 2, 2 n + 4 , . . ., where n is an integer</li>

                    <strong>Properties of integer 1</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Multiplying or dividing an expression by 1, in any form, does not change the value of that expression.</li>
                        <li>Dividing a number by itself results in 1 for any number n ≠ 0.</li>
                    </ol>

                <li>
                    <strong>Properties of integer 0: </strong>The integer 0 is neither  positive nor negative. If n is any number, then n + 0 = n and n ⋅ 0 = 0. Division by 0 is not defined.

                <li>A fraction is of the form 
                    \begin{equation}
                    \begin{split} 
                    \frac{n}{d}

                    \end{equation} 
                    where <em>n</em> is the <em>numerator</em> and <em>d</em> is the denominator.</li>
                <li>Two fractions are said to be equivalent if they represent the same fractions when reduced to the lowest terms by their <em>Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)</em></li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Addition and Subtraction of Fractions: </strong>Two fractions with the same denominator can be added or subtracted by performing the required operation with the numerators, leaving the denominators the same.
